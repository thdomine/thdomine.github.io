    My biggest hobbies is being a car-guy. I love european exotic cars, fast german sedans, american sports cars, fast trucks and SUVs. I very interested in how they work and how they are made. That is why with my skills in programming I would like to have a degree in software engineering and work on cars's computers.

    Outside of cars I love solving Rubik's Cube. I especially love doing speedcubing, it consists of solving a puzzles as fast as possible. They is even competitions held to know who can be the fastest speedcuber. I am planning, thiss summer to go in Colorado to do a competition.
    There is a lot of different Rubik's Cube. Some of my favorite are the 3*3*3,the 3*3*3 one-handed, the 2*2*2, the megaminx, the pyraminx and the skewb.
